  Went over with Mike what we want done for the next Sprint
  Rony: enable/disable for displaying value with characters, buttons should display color, names, values and also disable when the character dies. Have 3 human and 3 computer characters.  
  Joel: evaluation with ranges on sum, computer picks characters for battle one by one. Values carry over from selection to battle scene.
  Alex: Back to menu and replay buttons in review scene. Integrate scoreboard with actual vattle results.
