The user must remember values and ranges in order to win the game.\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience is?\r\nThere really is no target audience for this game. Anyone, at any age, can play and enjoy this game.\r\n\r\nHow it benefits them?\r\nThis game test the user memory through battling the computer. It will help the user with their memory since it will force them to remember both their numbers, the computers numbers and the range of combining the values to win, lose, or draw.\r\n\r\n###How the game works?\r\n\r\nThe game works by the user opening up the app and being greeted by a main menu screen. There the user selects start, which takes them to a selection scene. In this scene the user will click on a name that is in the list of names on the left hand side. Once a name is pressed a box will pop up with two random numbers. The user will pick one of those to be the value of the player that he clicked on. The computer will then do the same thing and will show the name of the player and the value that it selected in the computers player list, which is on the right hand side. This is continued until both lists are full, where it will display press start on the bottom of the scene.\r\n\r\nOnce start is pressed it will transition to the combat scene. In there you will see the your players along with their corresponding values and then also the other players with their value. The user then selects the player that they think will be able to get them the win. With a win, the user will keep their player, the computer will lose their player, and you will see that your player will perform an attack and win will appear. With a loss, you will lose your player, the computer will keep thiers, and the computer player will peform an attack and lose will appear. With a draw, both the user and computer will keep thier player, both will perform the attack, and draw will appear.\r\n\r\nThe game ends when either one of three outcomes occur; the user loses all of its players, the computer loses all of its players, or three draws occur. Once one of those happen, the game will move to a review scene. The review scene will recap the battle and will show who was played and what the result was. From their the user can either go back to the main menu or back to the selection scene.\r\n\r\n###Development and Future Work:\r\n\r\nThis app was made with the game editor called Unity. In Unity the scripts are written in C#, also this app uses all the apis that are associated with Unity.\r\n\r\nIn the future this game would be able to expand to harder levels with more characters and potentially different ranges.",
